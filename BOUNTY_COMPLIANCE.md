# World Mini-App Bounty Compliance

This document outlines how QuadWorldVote meets all the requirements for the World mini-app bounty.

## Bounty Requirements ✅

### 1. MiniKit Integration
- **Requirement**: "MUST use any of the Minikit SDK commands found on our docs"
- **Implementation**: 
  - Integrated `@worldcoin/minikit` package
  - Created `MiniKitProvider` component for environment detection
  - Wallet connection through MiniKit SDK
  - Authentication flow compatible with World App

### 2. World ID Verification
- **Requirement**: "Verify you're human" using World ID
- **Implementation**:
  - `WorldIDWidget` component using `@worldcoin/idkit`
  - Human verification required before voting
  - Proof verification in smart contracts
  - Prevents sybil attacks and ensures one vote per human

### 3. World Chain Deployment
- **Requirement**: "deploy your contracts to World Chain"
- **Implementation**:
  - Smart contracts deployed to World Chain (Chain ID: 480)
  - Free transaction fees for World App users
  - RPC endpoint: `https://worldchain.worldcoin.org`
  - Hardhat configuration for World Chain deployment

### 4. On-Chain Activity
- **Requirement**: "if your Mini App uses on-chain activity, deploy your contracts to World Chain"
- **Implementation**:
  - All voting data stored on-chain
  - Quadratic voting calculations verified on-chain
  - Results computed and stored in smart contracts
  - Full transparency and verifiability

### 5. Proof Validation
- **Requirement**: "proof validation is required and needs to occur in a web backend or smart contract"
- **Implementation**:
  - World ID proof verification in `castBallot()` function
  - Nullifier checking to prevent double voting
  - Merkle proof validation for human verification
  - All validation happens in smart contracts

### 6. Non-Gambling
- **Requirement**: "your project must not be gambling or chance based"
- **Implementation**:
  - Quadratic voting is a democratic decision-making mechanism
  - No random elements or chance-based outcomes
  - Based on user preferences and allocations
  - Transparent and deterministic results

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contracts
- **ContestFactory.sol**: Deploys new voting contests
- **Contest.sol**: Individual contest with quadratic voting logic
- **OpenZeppelin**: Security patterns and access controls
- **World ID Integration**: Proof verification in voting function

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14**: Modern React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive and modern UI design
- **Wagmi + RainbowKit**: Ethereum wallet integration
- **World ID Widget**: Human verification component

### Key Features
1. **Contest Creation**: Organizers can create voting contests with custom parameters
2. **Quadratic Voting**: Fair voting system with quadratic cost scaling
3. **Real-time Results**: Live leaderboard with verifiable on-chain data
4. **World ID Integration**: Human verification for each voter
5. **MiniKit Compatibility**: Seamless integration with World App

## User Flow

### Organizer Flow
1. Connect wallet via MiniKit
2. Verify humanity with World ID
3. Create contest with custom parameters
4. Add projects or enable public submissions
5. Monitor live results

### Voter Flow
1. Open mini-app in World App
2. Connect wallet (automatic via MiniKit)
3. Verify humanity with World ID
4. View available contests
5. Allocate credits using quadratic voting sliders
6. Submit vote (verified on-chain)
7. View results and leaderboard
